        <p>Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern
            India.
            TheTaj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān <b>(reigned 1628–58)</b> to immortalize his wife
            Mumtaz
            Mahal
            (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable
            companion since their marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely recognized building, it is
            situated
            in the
            eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort),
            also on the
            right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.</p>

    <p>In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is
        distinguished
        as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other
        attractions
        include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), lovely gardens, and a
        museum. One of the most beautiful structural compositions in the world, the Taj Mahal is also one of the
        world’s
        most iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists each year. The complex was designated a UNESCO World
        Heritage site in 1983.</p>
